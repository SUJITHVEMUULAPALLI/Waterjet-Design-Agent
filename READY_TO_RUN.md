## 🚀 HOW TO RUN

### Option 1: Use the Launcher (Recommended)
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\run_app.ps1

# Or Command Prompt
run_app.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\vemul\Downloads\waterjet_design_agent"

# Start the application
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 3: With Custom Port
```powershell
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

## 🌐 ACCESS THE APP

Once started, open your web browser and go to:
**http://localhost:8501**

## 🎨 WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

### 📐 Basic Shapes
- **Circle** (50mm to 300mm diameter)
- **Rectangle** (100x50mm to 400x200mm)
- **Square** (50mm to 300mm sides)
- **Triangle** (equilateral, various sizes)
- **Hexagon** (60mm to 360mm diameter)
- **Oval** (80x50mm to 480x300mm)

### ⭐ Decorative Shapes
- **Star** (5-point to 12-point variations)
- **Heart** (romantic designs in multiple sizes)

### 🔧 Functional Parts
- **Washer** (M8 to M20 standard sizes)
- **L-Bracket** (with mounting holes)

### 🌸 Artistic Designs
- **Mughal Medallion** (traditional ornate patterns)
- **Modern Leaf** (contemporary natural forms)

### 🔶 Geometric Patterns
- **Arabic Octagon** (Islamic-inspired geometry)

### 📝 Custom Elements
- **Text Panel** (signage and nameplates)

## 🎯 TESTING WORKFLOW

1. **Select a category** (e.g., "basic_shapes")
2. **Choose a shape** (e.g., "circle")
3. **Pick a style** (e.g., "geometric")
4. **Select material** (e.g., "steel")
5. **Choose size** (e.g., "Medium - 100mm diameter")
6. **Generate design** and download DXF

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

- **Start simple**: Try a basic circle first
- **Check materials**: Each shape has compatible materials
- **Review specs**: Thickness and detail limits are shown
- **Use standard sizes**: They're optimized for waterjet cutting
- **Test downloads**: Verify DXF files work with your CAM software

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### App Won't Start
```powershell
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
```

### Missing OpenAI Key
Create `.env` file with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Unicode Errors
```powershell
# Set encoding in PowerShell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
```
